# Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: <https://choropleth-map.freecodecamp.rocks>.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

1. My choropleth should have a title with a corresponding id="title".
2. My choropleth should have a description element with a corresponding id="description".
3. My choropleth should have counties with a corresponding class="county" that represent the data.
4. There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the counties.
5. My counties should each have data-fips and data-education properties containing their corresponding fips and education values.
6. My choropleth should have a county for each provided data point.
7. The counties should have data-fips and data-education values that match the sample data.
8. My choropleth should have a legend with a corresponding id="legend".
9. There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the legend.
10. I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.
11. My tooltip should have a data-education property that corresponds to the data-education of the active area.
